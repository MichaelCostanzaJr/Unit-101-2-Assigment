    <h5 class="underline">Who Am I?</h5>
    <p1 class="#">Hello, my name is Michael and i'm 25 years old and recently got out of the United States Navy. Throught my time in the Navy I have been stationed multiple places to include Illinois, Washington DC, Texas, and California. Califonria is where I currently reside with my beautiful wife Adrianna and our rescued pup Jack. In my free time I enojoy to surf and relax at the house.</p1>

    <h6 class="underline">Why Software Development?</h6>
    <p2 class="#"> Never in a million years have I ever thought I would be in the field of sofware development. In the Navy my primary role was in the medical field, but while I was working there was a lack of job satisfaction. As I transitioned out of the military I was lost. In time I came across software development. I was surprised on how interesting, new, and fresh it is!</p2>
